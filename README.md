Hello everyone! I'm Ali Afify, and I'd like to share a bit about my journey with you.

I graduated in 2014 from the Faculty of Science, where I specialized in Physics and Mathematics. Following that, I spent several years serving as an officer in the military, which was a unique experience that shaped my discipline and leadership skills.

After completing my service in 2017, I transitioned back into academia as a Physics teaching assistant. My passion for quantum science drove me to pursue a Master's degree in Quantum Computational Physics. Along the way, I've also had the privilege of publishing my research in worldwide scientific journals, contributing to the broader scientific community.

But my journey didn't stop there. I’ve always been fascinated by technology, so I dove into web development, mastering skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WordPress, Node.js, React.js, Redux, and MongoDB. This combination of science and tech has allowed me to approach problems in unique ways.

For three years, I worked as a freelancer, tackling diverse projects and honing my skills. That experience led me to establish OSBASH Company, where we specialize in programming and digital marketing. Through OSBASH, I’m passionate about helping businesses navigate the digital landscape and achieve their goals.
